    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ `batch_size`: In the context of neural networks, particularly those processing sequences like transformers, `batch_size` refers to the number of sequences processed together in one forward/backward pass. It is a crucial parameter in training, influencing memory usage and optimization dynamics. In the code, `batch_size` is derived from the shape of `last_hidden_states`, representing the number of sequences in the current batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ `hidden state`: In transformer models, the hidden state refers to the output of the transformer layers. For each token in the input sequence, the transformer generates a vector representation (hidden state) capturing the contextual information. These representations are essential for downstream tasks, encoding both the intrinsic meaning of the token and its relation to other tokens in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ `sequence_lengths`: This represents the actual length of each sequence in the batch, excluding padding tokens. In sequences processed by transformers, padding is often used to equalize the lengths of different sequences in a batch. `sequence_lengths` is calculated to identify the position of the last real (non-padding) token in each sequence.\n"

    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ The `last_token_pool` method first checks the padding direction used in the input sequences. The `left_padding` boolean variable is set to `True` if the last token of every sequence in the batch is a padding token. This is determined by checking if the sum of the last column in the `attention_mask` equals the batch size. If true, this implies all sequences are right-padded (common in English language processing tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ The line `left_padding = (attention_mask[:, -1].sum() == attention_mask.shape[0])` is used to determine the padding direction in tokenized sequences. Let's break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attention Mask Structure**: In transformer models, an attention mask is a binary matrix that indicates which tokens in the sequence are padding tokens (`0` for padding, `1` for real tokens). The shape of `attention_mask` is typically `[batch_size, sequence_length]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing `[:, -1]`**: This part selects the last column of the `attention_mask`. The `-1` index refers to the last element in a dimension, so this slice operation retrieves the padding status of the last token for each sequence in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`.sum()` Operation**: By summing the values of the last column, we are effectively counting how many sequences have a non-padding token as their last element. Since non-padding tokens are represented by `1`, the sum will equal the number of sequences that end with a real token.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparing to `attention_mask.shape[0]`**: `attention_mask.shape[0]` gives us the batch size, i.e., the total number of sequences. By comparing the sum to the batch size, we check whether all sequences in the batch have a non-padding token as their last element.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ If `left_padding` is `True`, this implies that all sequences in the batch end with a real token. Meaning the sum of the values in the last column of the attention mask equals the number of sequences in the batch. i.e. Sequences are left-padded. This means that padding tokens (if present) are at the start of the sequences, and the meaningful content (real tokens) follows the padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ Conversely, if `left_padding` is `False`, not all sequences end with a real token, implying that there is at least one sequence that is left-padded (the padding tokens are at the end). \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ This check is critical for correctly extracting the relevant token's representation from the sequences, especially when dealing with variable-length inputs in a batch. The method needs to know where the meaningful tokens end to avoid including padding representations in downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ If `left_padding` is `True`, the method retrieves the last token of each sequence, which is the last non-padding token. It does this by selecting the last column (`-1`) of `last_hidden_states`.\n",

For each sequence in the batch (identified by `torch.arange(batch_size)`), it selects the hidden state corresponding to the last real token (identified by `sequence_lengths`). Essentially, itâ€™s picking the hidden state of the last real token for each sequence in the batch, resulting in a tensor where each row corresponds to the last token's hidden state of each sequence.\n",

    "ðŸ“Œ When using these two tensors for indexing `last_hidden_states`, the operation selects a specific element from each sequence. The `torch.arange(batch_size)` part ensures that we are considering each sequence in the batch, and `sequence_lengths` picks the hidden state of the last real token in each sequence.\n",
    "\n",
